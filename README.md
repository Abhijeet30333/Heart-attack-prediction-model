# Heart-attack-prediction-model
The Heart Attack Prediction Model using Machine Learning is designed to assist in the early detection and prevention of heart attacks by analyzing patient health data to predict risk levels. Cardiovascular diseases are a leading cause of death globally, and timely risk assessment can significantly improve patient outcomes. This project leverages supervised machine learning algorithms to analyze key medical parameters such as age, sex, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, chest pain type, resting ECG results, and maximum heart rate, among others.

The dataset used for training and testing the model is sourced from publicly available medical records. Preprocessing techniques, including normalization and handling of missing values, are applied to improve data quality. Various classification algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines (SVM), Random Forest, and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) are trained and evaluated. Model performance is assessed using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

The best-performing model is selected to build a predictive tool that can aid healthcare professionals in identifying high-risk individuals. This system has the potential to enhance clinical decision-making, reduce mortality rates, and promote proactive heart health management. Future improvements may include integration with real-time health monitoring systems for continuous risk assessment.
